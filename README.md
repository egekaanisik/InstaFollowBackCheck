# InstaFollowBackCheck
Find the Instagram accounts that do not follow you back.

## Dependencies
* Python >= 3.6, recommend 3.8+
* Instagrapi*

*Modules will be installed automatically.

## Usage
The script will install the required modules first if they are not installed. After the installation process, users have to enter their credentials to get followed accounts and followers.* The results are printed and saved to a file on your desktop.

*NOTE: If you receive an email about a login attempt from an unrecognized device (for example Xiaomi Mi 5s), do not panic. The user agent that Instagrapi provides is different than your device. Also, do not run the script back to back. Instagram may see it as suspicious activity and temporarily lock your account.
